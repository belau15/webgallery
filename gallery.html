        <p>In Computer Art, I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to make my artwork. Before Computer Art, I didn't know how to work on these programs at all. I learned many kinds of stuff, including magic realism, the DADA movement, and transforming a image into something different. On top are the four works I have decided to show on Portfolio Night because I am the most proud of them out of all the work I have done.

        <p> My first artwork is "Photo Reality". I had to make something that would not happen in reality. So I made a ball monster in water. This is not reality because a ball with air in it cannot go underwater; it floats on to the top of the water. This was easy to make because I followed a tutotorial on YouTube that helped a lot. I liked how I could use my imagination and make it.

        <p> My second artwork is making my own business. For this assignment, I had to find a building in San Francisco and put a mural I found on the internet and place it on the wall of the building, and to name your own business. I chose a building in Downtown and I named it Tokyo Baguette because I like to eat pastries and desserts. It wasn't hard making this and it was lot of fun to make.

        <p> My third artwork is my work of Pixel Space Invaders. I did this assignment in the beginning of the school year, when I had to find three tutorials and create my own. At first, it was a bit diffcult because some of the instructions were a bit complex, but at the end I got it and finished it successfully. I'm proud of this because it looks just like the orignal pixel Space Invaders.
        </p>
        <p> . </p>
        <p> Lastly, my fourth artwork is a assignment based on magic realism. I had to do this for my finals. Magic realism is a famous style of art in which imaginary images or events are depicted in a sharply detailed, realistic manner. In my magic realism poster, there is a boy and a whale on a beach. I made it look like a dream by making the boy and the sand fade a bit. The boy has pink hair and funky colors, which you don't see that often in real life. One other thing I did was put color spots on the whale. I consider that magic realsim because whales don't have that. In the beginning it was diffcult to make because I did not have any ideas.  </p>      <!--Reflections about your artwork-->
